## Develop and Contribute

The Gazebo plugins in this repository follow the C++ [ROS style guidelines](http://ros.org/doc/groovy/api/roscpp/html) and conventions as closely as possible. However, because the plugins inherit from Gazebo classes and Gazebo follows a very different formatting standard, there are a few exceptions where Gazebo's function names do not comply to the ROS guidelines. This is fine, but code contributions should follow ROS's style as close as possible.

We welcome any contributions to this repo and encourage you to fork the project then send pull requests back to this parent repo. Thanks for your help!
